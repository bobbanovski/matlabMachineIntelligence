1. Image Processing
Involves extracting binary images from colours, cleaning up of images


2. Computer Vision

2.1 Hough Transform
Take all of the white points in a binary image, convert each point to its representation in Hough Space (sinusoid for lines, series of circles for circles), then find points of intersection - which represent actual features - the original line or circle in real space.
Manual implementation plus the equivalent pre-made implementation from Matlab.
